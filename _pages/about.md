I'm a health technologist with a broad range of specialisms and interests, including AI, (neuro)physiological sensing, and human movement analysis. My work is generally focussed on health applications to improve quality of life.

I'm a [Senior Lecturer in Health Technology at UWE Bristol](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/DavidWestern), based within the [Health Tech Hub (HTH)](https://www.healthtechhub.co.uk/). The HTH is a research centre focussed on supporting innovation in the Bristol region's health tech industry.

I'm co-leader of the [REACH research group](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/reach).

If you're interested collaboration, consultation, or PhD supervision, feel free to get in touch.
