I'm a health technologist with a broad range of specialisms and interests, including AI, (neuro)physiological sensing, and human movement analysis. My work is generally focussed on health applications to improve quality of life, with increasing emphasis on developing trustworthy mechanisms for real-word validation and deployment of health data technologies.

I'm a [Senior Lecturer in Health Technology at UWE Bristol](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/DavidWestern), based within the [Health Tech Hub (HTH)](https://www.healthtechhub.co.uk/). The HTH is a research centre focussed on supporting innovation in the Bristol region's health tech industry.

I'm leader of the [REACH research group](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/reach). You can follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reach-brl).
