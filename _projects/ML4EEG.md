## Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a cornerstone clinical tool for diagnosing and monitoring neurological conditions like epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain injuries. However, clinical EEG interpretation faces significant challenges, including a shortage of expert interpreters and inherent variability between human analysts.

My research addresses these challenges through state-of-the-art machine learning methods, leveraging deep neural architectures, transformer models, and multi-instance learning frameworks. Our team at UWE Bristol has achieved groundbreaking accuracy, significantly surpassing conventional methods and achieving or exceeding human inter-rater agreement benchmarks.

## Key Contributions

* **Transformer-Based EEG Classification**: Applied transformer architectures to EEG interpretation, dramatically improving accuracy on standard datasets (e.g., TUAB).
* **Multiple Instance Learning**: Pioneered treating EEG interpretation as a multiple-instance learning problem, significantly enhancing model robustness.
* **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Integrated EEG data with contextual clinical information to create richer, more informative diagnostic systems.

## Current and Future Directions

My ongoing focusses on clinical translation of these advanced AI methods, particularly:
* validation against real-world NHS datasets within a secure data environment.
* wrapping the core tech with interfaces to support clinical integration.
* exploring novel business models for trustworthy commercialisation of health data technologies.
