## Project Summary

This post-doctoral position at University of Bristol, supervised by Prof Simon Neild and Dr Rick Hyde, focussed on two key aims related to tremor in people with multiple sclerosis:
- Development of a wearable robotic orthosis to suppress tremor and restore independence for activities of daily living.
- Development and evaluation of an IMU-based motion capture system for precise, detailed, objective evaluation of tremor.

Key findings: The developed orthosis, focussing on tremor at the elbow and using an electromagnetic brake for adaptive friction control, was capable of surpressing tremor,
but to do so while satisfying user acceptance criteria (weight, aesthetics, comfort, easy of donning/doffing) was not possible with the technologies available at the time.
However, our motion capture system proved effective, by automatically tailoring the tremor severity measurement to the patient's individual tremor characteristics (distribution of amplitude between the joints). 
We showed that, unlike the conventional sensor-based and clinical metrics, the newly proposed ’change in scale’ metrics presented statistically significant correlations with changes in self-assessed impact of tremor.
