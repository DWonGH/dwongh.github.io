I joined the RoboSafe project as a post-doctoral researcher (part-time, 2014-2016). This project focused on the safety and reliability of autonomous robotic systems. Its goal was to develop frameworks, methodologies, and tools to ensure that robotic agents can operate safely in complex, real-world environments. 
We gave particular attention to the challenge of fusing verification and validation across multiple levels of abstraction - realistic testing, detailed simulation, and highly abstracted formal modelling - to combine realism and exhaustiveness in a corroborative framework.
